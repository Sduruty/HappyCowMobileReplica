#### Made at Le Reacteur

As I made this as an end of training project and had a deadline, I am aware that it isn't perfect and still can be improved.
Because of the deadline I had to stop modifying it, but I'll come back to it soon.

Skills: REACT / REACT NATIVE / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS, REACT, REACT NATIVE

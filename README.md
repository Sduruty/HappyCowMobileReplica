### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is my Happy Cow Mobile Replica

#### Made at Le Reacteur

As I made this copy of Happycow mobile app as an end of training project and had a deadline, I am aware that it isn't perfect and still can be improved.
Because of the deadline I had to stop modifying it, but I'll come back to it soon.

Searchbar is case sensitive, so you'll have to type in the exact name of restaurant.

I did'nt had time to create backend, so it currently works with JSON file related to Paris.

I didn't had time to manage when there is no picture, so a white square will appear instead. I'd like to put happycow logo and category logo instead.

Favorites, reviews, pictures and calls doesn't work neither.

I attended Le Reacteur's Bootcamp from October to December 2020.

Skills: REACT / REACT NATIVE / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS, REACT, REACT NATIVE

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is my Happy Cow Mobile Replica

#### Made at Le Reacteur

As I made this copy of Happycow mobile app as an end of training project and had a deadline, I am aware that it isn't perfect and still can be improved.
Because of the deadline I had to stop modifying it, but I'll come back to it soon.

SplashScreen is a screen capture of the real app.

Searchbar is case sensitive, so you'll have to type in the exact name of restaurant.

Filters do their job.

I didn't had time to create backend, so it currently works with JSON file related to Paris.

I didn't had time to manage when there is no picture, so a white square will appear instead. I'd like to put happycow logo and category logo instead.

Favorites, reviews, pictures and calls doesn't work neither. Still have to rename two categories in order to make them more understandable while reading the code.

I attended Le Reacteur's Bootcamp from October to December 2020.
